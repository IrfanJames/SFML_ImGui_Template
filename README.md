> This Project help you code 80% of an App of Medium Complexity in 4-5 Hours

> This project has the following out of the box
> 
>  - [x] Already Setup
>    - [x] SFML
>      * With simple things handled
>      * Like changing the View Size when resized
>      * Added Dragging through world-space
>    - [x] Dear ImGui (For GUI)
>      * By Default Docking is Enables
>      * You can use both Docking and non-docking versions
>    - [x] Firebase c++ sdk (For Online Database etc)
>      * The binaries are in GBs
>      * so it is Optional, and doesn't come in default BlankApp
>  - [x] Three Configs
>    * Debug
>    * Realase
>    * Dist
>  - [x] Embedded [Resource Manager](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Resource-Manager) (Embed any type of Assest in .exe itself)
>  - [x] [Utility Libraries](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Utils)
>    - [x] [Timer](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Timer)
>    - [x] [Logging](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Logging)
>      * Only Debug has Console
>      * Realase prints in .txt file (automatically generated)
>      * Dist disables Logging
>      * All 3 behaviors with same code (but in differnt configs)
>    - [x] Open/Save As [Dialog Box](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Dialog-Boxes) (Window Native)
>  - [x] A Simple Software Architecture
