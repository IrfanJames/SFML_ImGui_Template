A Complete Project of Blank App with everything working

> This Project (with its easy simple architecture) helps you to code 80% of an App of Medium Complexity in 4-5 Hours

## This project has the following out of the box
- [x] Already Setup
  - [x] [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
    * With simple things handled
    * Like changing the View Size when resized
    * Added Dragging through world-space
  - [x] [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (For GUI)
    * By Default Docking is Enables
    * You can use both Docking and non-docking versions
  - [x] [Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/) [C++ SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/cpp) (For Online Database etc)
    * The binaries are in GBs
    * so it is Optional, and doesn't come in default BlankApp
- [x] Three Configs
    * Debug
    * Release
    * Dist
- [x] Embedded [Resource Manager](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Resource-Manager) (Embed any type of Assest in .exe itself)
- [x] [Utility Libraries](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Utils)
    - [x] [Timer](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Timer)
    - [x] [Logging](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Logging)
      * Only Debug has Console
      * Release prints in .txt file (automatically generated)
      * Dist disables Logging
      * All 3 behaviours with same code (but in different configs)
    - [x] Open/Save As [Dialog Box](https://github.com/IrfanJames/SFML_ImGui_Template/wiki/Dialog-Boxes) (Window Native)
- [x] A Simple Software Architecture
    * It Separates unrelated Systems into different Namespaces

> Remember this is a Project with just some Code already written
> 
> And does NOT constrict you in any way
